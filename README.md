🍪 This is my first cookiecutter that contains some files what I always prepare when making a new Python repository. The cookiecutter is now growing... I wish I can continuously upgrade it.

## How to use

```bash
# If you don't have cookiecutter command.
python -m pip install cookiecutter

# Create your project.
